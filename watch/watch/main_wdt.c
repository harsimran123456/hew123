* File Name     : main_wdt.c
* Version       : 1.1
* Device(s)     : R5F562N8
* Tool-Chain    : Renesas RX Standard Toolchain 1.0.1
* OS            : None
* H/W Platform  : YRDKRX62N
* Description   : This sample demonstrates usage of the watchdog timer, by 
*                 configuring the timer to require periodic resets to prevent
*                 a timer overflow. The sample configures a periodic timer reset
*                 which has a period that varies with the position of the
*                 potentiometer, VR1. The LEDs flash to indicate each period.
*
* Operation     : 1. Build and download the sample code to the YRDK.
*
*                 2. Ensure the potentiometer, VR1, is turned to the fully counter-
*                    clockwise position before starting the sample. To start the
*                    sample, click 'Reset Go'.
*                    
*                 3. The debug LCD will display the sample name, and the user
*                    LEDs will begin to flash.
*                    
*                 4. Slowly turn the potentiometer VR1 clockwise, and observe the
*                    gradual decrease the LED flash rate. Each time the LEDs 
*                    toggle output state, the watchdog timer is reset, preventing
*                    it from triggering an overflow interrupt.
*                    
*                 5. Continue to turn the potentiometer clockwise - the LED
*                    flashing will slow down to a point where the watchdog timer
*                    is allowed to overflow.
*                    
*                 6. When the timer has overflowed, the LEDs will stay constantly
*                    lit, and the program will wait in an infinite while loop. 
*                    The debug LCD will display "Watchdog Overflow".
*                    
*                 7. To repeat the sample, ensure RV1 is fully counter-clockwise
*                    and click 'Reset Go'.
